A   further challenge would be to get this running so fast it appears instant.                                                                   |   |

One potential challenge is defining the colors between, as they may look less   clear                                                                                                                                     |   |

Firstly a new bunch   of network requests will need to be sent off and be processed, and then the   rendered map will need to be re-rendered without page load. If the map is for   a specific location zoom will need to be set as well.    |   |

Also suitable UI   components developed and implemented.
